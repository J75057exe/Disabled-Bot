# Disabled-Bot
A bot that repeats whatever a user types but in a stupid fashion
To install create a new discord app, and scroll down and click create bot.
Then click show token and save it. Then go to the gen UOAUTH thing and get the url, and add it to the server you want.
Then in the script, replace the 'XXXXXXXXXX' part with the bot's token, then just run the bot and there you have it. Type !disableHelp for a list of commands
